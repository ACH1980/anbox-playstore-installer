# Google Play and Houdini installer for Debian Anbox
A forked version of the snap Anbox to work on Debian 9/10 version of Anbox.
It was inspired by the following script found on:
https://forum.manjaro.org/t/running-android-applications-on-arch-using-anbox/53332

It may be necessary to read /usr/share/doc/anbox/README.Debian in order to install the Android rootfs image, and the kernel modules, once installed anbox by apt (apt install anbox).

Usually the Debian build of Anbox are a kind of stable version, and it is not updated as fast as the snap version.
